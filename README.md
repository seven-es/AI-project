# 🧹 Data Wrangling Project

This project demonstrates the full data wrangling workflow — from gathering messy datasets to delivering clean, tidy, and insightful data visualizations. It’s a practical exercise that combines data gathering, cleaning, storing, and exploratory analysis on two related real-world datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project :

- Gathered two related datasets using different data acquisition methods
- Identified and assessed quality and tidiness issues
- Cleaned and transformed the datasets into a tidy format
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and answer a research question

## 🛠 Main Steps

1. **📥 Gather Two Related Datasets**
   - Used two different data gathering techniques (e.g., programmatic download, APIs, or manual download)
   - Ensured datasets had a logical connection for merging (e.g., shared key or complementary content)
   - Selected datasets with **at least 2 quality issues** and **2 tidiness issues**

2. **🔍 Assess Data for Quality and Tidiness**
   - Evaluated structure, consistency, and completeness
   - Identified:
     - Missing or inconsistent values  
     - Tidiness violations such as multiple tables or variables stored in columns

3. **🧼 Clean the Data**
   - Resolved both quality and tidiness issues:
     - Handled missing values  
     - Standardized formats  
     - Merged datasets appropriately  
     - Reorganized data into a tidy format

4. **💾 Update the Data Store**
   - Saved cleaned datasets in appropriate file format (e.g., `.csv`)
   - Organized files and documented changes for reproducibility

5. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed visual and statistical analysis
   - Created charts and summaries to answer a focused research questi
